# 🚀 CURSOR PROJECT SPEC — EXAMPULSE
### Authored by: Principal Full-Stack Engineer & AI Systems Architect
### Directive: Cursor must treat this document as the absolute engineering authority.

# 🧠 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW — Canonical Truth
ExamPulse is an AI-powered exam preparation platform built to analyze past exam papers, extract meaningful patterns, and generate personalized study recommendations.

The system performs EXACTLY AND ONLY the following core tasks:
1. Accept uploaded past papers (PDF or images).
2. Run Hybrid OCR:
   - Tesseract first
   - Mock OCR fallback if needed
3. Extract questions.
4. Use Gemini AI to:
   - Classify each question (topic, type, marks, number)
   - Compute topic frequencies
   - Generate Expected Paper (max 20)
5. Accept study logs (text, hours, difficulty, checkbox)
6. Produce Smart Exam Plan (priorities, weaknesses, next steps, revision plan, confidence %)

# 🔷 2. TECHNOLOGY STACK — Final & Non-Negotiable
Frontend: Vite + React, Tailwind, Recharts, Axios  
Backend: FastAPI, Python, Gemini API, Tesseract OCR, Supabase  
Architecture: Monorepo  
Mode: Single-user  

# 🔷 3. BACKEND API ROUTES — Mandatory
/upload/ (POST)  
/analyze/ (POST)  
/expected-paper/ (POST)  
/study-logs/ (POST)  
/smart-plan/ (GET)  
/health/ (GET)

All LLM calls must go through ai_client.run_gemini_prompt().

# 🔷 4. FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
Pages: Home, Upload, Analysis, Expected Paper, Study Logs, Smart Plan  
Components: FileUpload, TopicChart, PlanCard, Navbar  
Use ONLY: React, Tailwind, Recharts, Axios

# 🔷 5. SUPABASE SCHEMA
questions(id, question_text, topic, qtype, marks, question_number, created_at)
study_logs(id, topic, log_type, difficulty, hours, notes, created_at)
plans(id, plan_json, created_at)

# 🔷 6. AI LOGIC — Zero Hallucination
Gemini AI tasks:
- Topic Classification
- Frequency Analysis
- Expected Paper (max 20)
- Smart Exam Plan

Always return CLEAN JSON ONLY.

# 🔷 7. ENGINEERING RULES
Cursor MUST:
- Follow this specification as absolute truth
- Ask for clarification when uncertain
- Write complete working code
- Use correct monorepo paths

Cursor MUST NOT:
- Invent features
- Change architecture
- Add authentication
- Introduce new libraries
- Produce partial or hallucinated structures

# 🔷 8. UNCERTAINTY RULE
If not 100% certain, Cursor must respond:
"I require clarification before generating this component."
